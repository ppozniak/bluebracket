      <h4>Teaching</h4>
      <p>As I've mentioned earlier I really enjoy teaching and sharing my knowledge and this project is a fruit of it. I had to first learn Vue, so I can teach about it! Two friends of mine were given a chance to take a part in iternship program, but they needed some pre-training, so I proposed that I'll show them a thing or two.</p>

      <p>Apart of that I've been giving some lectures about JavaScript and RWD basics at <a href="https://camp.squiz.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squiz Camp</a>, while only two years earlier I was there as a student, after that I got my first job.</p>

      <h4>Voice recognition</h4>
      <p>In the meantime of creating this simple app I've learned about native voice recognition and text-to-speech, so I've decided to use it in app. For now it's just a simple "add" command, which adds a new counter.</p>
