      <h4>The hard way</h4>
      <p>This was my first real project in my career. Got dropped into the deep waters. The website itself is not perfect and I am aware of that, but it has opened my eyes to many problems which now I avoid, especially in terms of SASS nesting - it's bad. After that I immediately learned BEM methodology and I'm using it till today. Now I know that CSS specificity can hurt.</p>
